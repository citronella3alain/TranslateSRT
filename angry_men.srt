1
00:01:18,853 --> 00:01:21,559
You did a wonderful job. Wonderful.

2
00:01:23,569 --> 00:01:25,644
You did it. You did it!

3
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:34,283
To continue, you've listened to a long and
complex case, murder in the first degree.

4
00:01:34,373 --> 00:01:39,417
Premeditated murder is the most serious
charge tried in our criminal courts.

5
00:01:39,506 --> 00:01:44,215
You've listened to the testimony, had the
law interpreted as it applies in this case.

6
00:01:44,303 --> 00:01:49,014
It's now your duty to sit down and try
and separate the facts from the fancy.

7
00:01:49,102 --> 00:01:53,350
One man is dead.
Another man's life is at stake.

8
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:57,486
If there's a reasonable doubt in your
minds as to the guilt of the accused -

9
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,399
a reasonable doubt-then you must
bring me a verdict of not guilty.

10
00:02:02,493 --> 00:02:06,540
If there's no reasonable doubt,
then you must, in good conscience,

11
00:02:06,624 --> 00:02:09,542
find the accused guilty.

12
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,497
However you decide,
your verdict must be unanimous.

13
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:17,043
In the event that
you find the accused guilty,

14
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,424
the bench will not entertain
a recommendation for mercy.

15
00:02:20,517 --> 00:02:23,769
The death sentence is mandatory
in this case.

16
00:02:24,147 --> 00:02:28,394
You are faced with a grave responsibility.
Thank you, gentlemen.

17
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:32,983
The alternate jurors are excused.

18
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:39,989
The jury will now retire.

19
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,270
- Wanna piece of gum?
- No, thanks.

20
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:06,178
This thing isn't movin'.

21
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:12,611
- I'll give you a hand.
- That's it.

22
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:20,742
You know somethin'? I called
the Weather Bureau this morning.

23
00:05:20,835 --> 00:05:23,838
This is gonna be
the hottest day of the year.

24
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:26,592
You'd think they'd air-condition this place.

25
00:05:26,677 --> 00:05:29,927
- What is your name, sir?
- Oh, it's... that one. Yeah.

26
00:05:30,014 --> 00:05:34,179
Thank you very much.
OK, gentlemen. Everybody's here.

27
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:39,431
Now, if there's anything you want,
I'll be right outside the door. Just knock.

28
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:54,794
Good morning.
I never knew they locked the door.

29
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:57,916
Sure they lock the door.
What'd you think?

30
00:05:58,008 --> 00:06:01,130
I don't know. It just never occurred to me.

31
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:05,923
- What's that for?
- I thought we might wanna vote by ballot.

32
00:06:06,019 --> 00:06:10,183
Great idea. Maybe we can
get him elected senator.

33
00:06:16,032 --> 00:06:19,865
- How'd you like it?
- I don't know. It was pretty interesting.

34
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:24,700
- Yeah? I almost fell asleep.
- I mean, I've never been on a jury before.

35
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:27,367
No? I've sat on many juries.

36
00:06:28,506 --> 00:06:33,883
Those lawyers talk and talk, even when
it's an open-and-shut case like this one.

37
00:06:33,972 --> 00:06:37,556
- Ever hear so much talk about nothin'?
- I guess they're entitled.

38
00:06:37,643 --> 00:06:40,894
They're entitled. It's the system, but...

39
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:45,609
if you ask me, I'd slap those tough kids
down before they start any trouble.

40
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:49,232
It saves a lot of time and money.
Let's get started.

41
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,996
Yeah. We've probably all
got things to do here.

42
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,028
We can start with a five-minute break.
One gentleman is in the bathroom.

43
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:58,203
Are... we gonna sit in order?

44
00:06:58,296 --> 00:07:01,001
Gee, I don't know. I guess so.

45
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:08,297
- Buddy
